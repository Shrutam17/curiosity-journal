Ava: I still can’t get over how stunning Milford Sound was. That cruise through the fjords felt like something out of a fantasy movie.
Liam: Seriously! The waterfalls tumbling down those cliffs… and remember when that seal popped up right next to the boat?
Ava: Yes! That little guy stole the show. I’ve never seen water that clear and dramatic before.
Liam: Queenstown was unreal too. The jet boat ride on the Shotover River had my heart racing!
Ava: Haha, I thought you were going to fall out with how you screamed. But yeah, adrenaline capital of the world for a reason!
Liam: And that burger place — Fergburger, right? I swear I’m still dreaming about that lamb burger.
Ava: Worth every second of the line. Oh, and those evening walks by Lake Wakatipu were so peaceful.
Liam: Rotorua was a totally different vibe — the geothermal pools, the bubbling mud, and that eggy smell everywhere!
Ava: Haha, yeah, that smell hits you hard! But the Māori cultural show and the hangi dinner were incredible. So much history and warmth.
Liam: I really liked the glowworm caves in Waitomo too. It was like staring up at a galaxy underground.
Ava: That was magical. I was expecting cool, but not that magical.
Liam: I already miss it all. If I could teleport back to Wanaka and sit by that lone tree again, I would.
Ava: Same. That trip was unforgettable. We need to print these memories before they start to blur.
Liam: Let’s make a travel journal! Quotes, photos, everything. I want to remember the little things too.
